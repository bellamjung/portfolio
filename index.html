      <h2>Travel</h2>
      <p>Let's go on an adventure. “Books are the plane, and the train, and the road. They are the destination, and the journey. They are home.”
― Anna Quindlen “Wherever you go becomes a part of you somehow.”
― Anita Desai “What is that feeling when you're driving away from people and they recede on the plain till you see their specks dispersing? - it's the too-huge world vaulting us, and it's good-bye. But we lean forward to the next crazy venture beneath the skies.”
― Jack Kerouac
“I think you travel to search and you come back home to find yourself there.”
― Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie “Don’t tell me how educated you are, tell me how much you have travelled.” – Mohammed “I haven’t been everywhere, but it’s on my list.” –Susan Sontag “It feels good to be lost in the right direction” "Trendy is the last stage before tacky." —Karl Lagerfeld "People will stare. Make it worth their while." —Harry Winston "Playing dress-up begins at age five and never truly ends." —Kate Spade "I make clothes, women make fashion." —Azzedine Alaïa</p>

      <h2>Fashion</h2>
      <p>"What is she wearing?" "When in doubt, wear red." —Bill Blass  "You gotta have style. It helps you get down the stairs. It helps you get up in the morning. It’s a way of life. Without it, you’re nobody. I’m not talking about lots of clothes.” —Diana Vreeland

      <h2>Beauty</h2>
      <p>Look in the mirror. “For attractive lips, speak words of kindness. For lovely eyes, seek out the good in people.” —Audrey Hepburn “If you want to know your worth Look to the women you surround yourself with Relish in their accomplishments Think of how the smile in their voice is contagious Remember their struggles And how they overcame them with such grace Do not forget that sometimes it was hard for them to laugh But they did They remained strong and beautiful despite the challenges Now Look at yourself And think these things, too” "if you had a friend who spoke to you in the same way you sometimes speak to yourself, how long would you allow that person to be your friend?" "I wish you the best but I'm the best" "You see things and you understand. You're a wallflower" - Perks of Being a Wallflower (StephenChbosky)</p>

      <h2>Self</h2>
      <p>Discovery and reflection. "anyone else have a heart thats too soft….. a marshmallow heart…… tempur-pedic mattress heart…. a cotton candy heart….." things to be happy about:
- finding a new favorite song
- taking a hot bath when you’re really cold
- finishing a good book
- falling asleep at the beach
- sunscreen on a babies nose
- getting into a freshly made bed
- coming home after a long vacation
- watching the people you love most laugh
- painting your nails
- hot cups of tea when it’s raining
- coming home after a long day
- waking up and stretching" It's okay to lose yourself for a little while. In books, in music, in art. Let yourself get lost. "Just because you took longer than others, doesn't mean you failed.Remember that. “Become friends with people who aren’t your age. Hang out with people whose first language isn’t the same as yours. Get to know someone who doesn’t come from your social class. This is how you see the world. This is how you grow.”
— Unknown" “People walk into one another’s lives for a reason. It’s not always the one you hope, but that doesn’t lessen the experience. That best friend that you drifted away from, you helped her realize that she didn’t need to live under her parent’s thumb because she’s strong enough to be independent. That almost-boyfriend you had, he made you realize that you have so much value and that you deserve so much more than what you’ve been asking for. That person that betrayed you, you taught them that causing wounds in others just deepens the wounds in themselves rather than heal them- and they taught you that a bad choice does not mean a bad person. Sometimes people come into your life to be a sword or a shield. They are there to help fight a battle and once that battle is over, they are no longer necessary. So never be sad about the people no longer in your life- you served your purpose and that battle is over. Look back and smile instead.”
